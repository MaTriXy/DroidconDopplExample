In this presentation we'll share insights into our process for reducing battery consumption by the Facebook family of applications on both Android and iOS including: the main causes of battery drain (everything from radio wake-ups to invisible animations), instrumenting and modeling battery drain (without relying on the OS reported battery level), and general best practices for reducing battery consumption by an app.","category":null,"startDate":"11/06/2017 05:30PM","endDate":"11/06/2017 06:15PM","publicEvent":true,"rsvpCount":0,"speakers":[{"id":94554,"name":"Abhishek Choudhary","profile":"I work as Software Engineer on the Core Health Team at Facebook  whose mission is to make Facebook products and apps a highly reliable experience for our users and make our products be extremely efficient in resource usage.","avatarKey":"User_894d2923-918a-458b-9f3b-200bce0a2887","userCode":"65251","company":"Facebook","twitter":"","linkedIn":"","website":"","email":null,"phone":null,"phoneticName":null,"gPlus":null,"nickname":null,"coverKey":null,"facebook":null,"emailPublic":false,"following":false},{"id":35173,"name":"Kunal Bhalla","profile":"I'm a Software Engineer at Facebook New York working on Android – mainly focused on reducing battery consumption and preventing regressions.","avatarKey":"User_2d3c3722-371c-4b03-81a6-887afaca863b","userCode":"46152","company":"Facebook","twitter":"kunalbhalla","linkedIn":null,"website":"http://explog.in","email":null,"phone":null,"phoneticName":null,"gPlus":null,"nickname":null,"coverKey":null,"facebook":"http://www.facebook.com/kunalbhalla","emailPublic":false,"following":false}]},{"id":111615,"name":"Stay Calm and Modularize","description":"Modularizing your app into smaller functional code modules comes with many benefits: smaller APK sizes mean that your users download your app faster, which is particularly important in emerging markets. It's also a critical step for building Instant Apps: applications which provide a native experience without requiring user installation. While modularization sounds great, it can be a daunting task. This talk will focus on various strategies for shrinking your APK size, using the refactoring tools found in Android Studio 3.0, as well as tips for taking your modularized app and turning it into an Instant app.","category":null,"startDate":"11/05/2017 04:30PM","endDate":"11/05/2017 05:15PM","publicEvent":true,"rsvpCount":0,"speakers":[{"id":94353,"name":"Lyla Fujiwara","profile":"Lyla Fujiwara is an Android Developer Advocate at Google.
